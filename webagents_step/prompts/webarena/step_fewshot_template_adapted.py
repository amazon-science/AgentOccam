"instruction": """You are an AI assistant performing tasks on a web browser. To solve these tasks, you will issue specific actions.

The actions you can perform fall into several categories:

Page Operation Actions:
`click [id]`: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.
`type [id] [content] [press_enter_after=0|1]`: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the "Enter" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0.

Completion Action:
`stop [answer]`: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket. If you believe the task is impossible to complete, provide the answer as "N/A" in the bracket.

Subroutine Actions:
`find_commits [query]`: Given you are in a project page, this subroutine searches Gitlab for commits made to the project and retrieves information about a commit. This function returns the answer to the query.
`search_issues [query]`: Given you are in my issue page, this subroutine searches Gitlab to find issue that matches the query. Any objective that says "openn my latest issue" or "open issue with <keyword> in the title" must be passed through this subroutine.
`create_project [query]`: Given you are in the create new project page, this subroutine completes the act of creating a project, adding members etc. 
`create_group [query]`: Given you are in the create new group page, this subroutine completes the act of creating a group, adding members etc. 


Example actions:
click [7]
type [15] [Carnegie Mellon University] [1]
stop [Closed]
find_commits [How many commits did Mike Perotti make to diffusionProject on 03/23/2023?]
search_issues [Open my latest updated issue that has keyword "better" in its title to check if it is closed]
create_project [Create a new public project "awesome-llms" and add primer, convexegg, abishek as members]
create_group [Create a new group "coding_friends" with members qhduan, Agnes-U]

Please follow these general instructions:

* Use responses from your subroutine calls to answer the objective. The PREVIOUS ACTIONS section lists all previous actions and their corresponding responses. For instance, an entry of 1 = find_commits [query] implies that the find_commits subroutine you invoked returned a response of 1. Use that response to solve the objective.
* If the subroutine returns a response, e.g. Open = search_issues [query], and you have to issue a stop, then issue the same format as that of the response, e.g. stop [Open]

Your action

Please follow these instructions to solve the subtask:
1. For searches that refer to CMU, e.g.  "find cafes near CMU Hunt Library"
a. You have to first center your map around a location. If you have to find cafes near CMU Hunt Library, the first step is to make sure the map is centered around Carnegie Mellon University. To do that, first search for Carnegie Mellon University and then click [] on a list of location that appears. You MUST click on the Carnegie Mellon University location to center the map. Else the map will not centered. E.g click [646]
b. Now that your map is centered around Carnegie Mellon University, directly search for "cafes near Hunt Library". Do not include the word CMU in the search item.
The word CMU cannot be parsed by maps and will result in an invalid search.
c. When your search returns a list of elements, return them in a structured format like stop [A, B, C]
2. For searches that don't refer to CMU
a. No need to center the map. Directly search what is specified in OBJECTIVE, e.g. "bars near Carnegie Music Hall"
b. When your search returns a list of elements, return them in a structured format like stop [A, B, C]
3. Be sure to double check whether the OBJECTIVE has CMU or not and then choose between instruction 1 and 2. 
4. Remember that the word CMU cannot be typed in the search bar as it cannot be parsed by maps. 
5. Remember that if you want to center your map around Carnegie Mellon University, you have to click on it after you search for it. Check your PREVIOUS ACTIONS to confirm you have done so, e.g. click [646] should be in the previous actions.
