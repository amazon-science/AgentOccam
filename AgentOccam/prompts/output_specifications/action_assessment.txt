Assess the value and risk of each action. Consider both the best-case and worst-case outcomes resulting from its implementation. Itemize the assessment using this format: `- action [action_id]: [action value, including but not limited to what outcomes you can expect by executing the action, or whether the note is of the most correct and comprehensive content] [action risk, including but not limited to whether the note/stop content is correct, and whether you can gather more information by continuing playing rather than ending the trial] [{best_case}] [{worst_case}]`.
